# Meal Planner (MERN Stack Project)

> This MERN (MongoDB/Mongoose + Express + Reac.js + Node.js) stack project allowes you to plan your meals by adding their names and ingredients to the database and manupulating them (getting, adding, editing, deleting meals).

## The goals of creating this application:

The main goals for me as a web developer were to improve my skills in working with:

- Node.js:
  - creating a server using Express;
  - connecting to the remote database;
  - implementing the basic CRUD operations: create, read, update, delete the data objects using a Mongoose model;
- MongoDB Atlas:
  - creating a cluster and database collection;
  - connecting the cluster to the application;
- React.js:
  - processing the CRUD backend operations on the frontend (fetching data, storing it in the array, manipulating it using axios and JavaScript methods);
  - lazy loading on the data fetching;
  - changing the button title conditionally;
